# Catia_Projects
A collection of 2D and 3D mechanical designs created in CATIA, including part models, assemblies, and detailed drawings.
About the Project

This repository contains a collection of 2D drawings and 3D models created using CATIA V5.
The designs include mechanical components, assemblies, and technical drawings that demonstrate my CAD modeling and drafting skills.

üìÇ Contents

2D Drafting: Sketches, orthographic views, and dimensioned technical drawings.

3D Modeling: Part files (.CATPart), assemblies (.CATProduct), and surface models.

Exported Files: STEP/IGES formats for compatibility and PDFs for quick previews.

üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Software

CATIA V5 (Part Design, Assembly Design, Drafting, Surface Design)

Exported files viewable in most CAD software (e.g., SolidWorks, AutoCAD, Fusion 360, FreeCAD).
